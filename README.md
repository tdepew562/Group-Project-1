# Project 1: Data Analysis on Jobs

## Overview
Project 1 is a collaborative effort undertaken by a group of individuals focusing on analyzing job data from various perspectives within the data industry. Each member of the group explored a specific aspect of the dataset to gain insights and present findings.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). It contains comprehensive information about jobs in the data industry, including job titles, company sizes, work settings, salaries, and geographic locations. The dataset can be found in the repository under the Resources folder.

## Group Members and Insights
- **Thomas**: Explored the top three job titles per year.
- **Chai**: Investigated the correlation between company size and salary, as well as the relationship between work settings and salaries.
- **Amy**: Analyzed the country with the highest average salary in data jobs.
- **Jessica**: Examined the correlation between high salaries and job categories.
